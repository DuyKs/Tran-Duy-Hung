1. Logic Errors

a. Undefined Variable in Filtering Logic
Problem:
```tsx
const balancePriority = getPriority(balance.blockchain);
if (lhsPriority > -99) {
  if (balance.amount <= 0) {
    return true;
  }
}
```
The variable lhsPriority is used, but it is undefined in this context. The intention was likely to use balancePriority.
Impact: This results in a runtime error, preventing the filtering logic from executing.

Fix: Replace lhsPriority with balancePriority:

```tsx
if (balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0) {
  return true;
}
```
b. Incorrect Filtering Condition
Problem:

```tsx
if (balance.amount <= 0) {
  return true;
}
```
This condition filters in balances with amounts <= 0 instead of excluding them. This is likely the opposite of the intended behavior.
Impact: Wallet balances with zero or negative amounts are included in the results, which may be undesirable.
Fix: Update the condition to only include balances with positive amounts:

```tsx
if (balance.amount > 0) {
  return true;
}
```
c. Sorting Logic Lacks Tie Handling
Problem:

```tsx
sortedBalances.sort((lhs, rhs) => {
  const leftPriority = getPriority(lhs.blockchain);
  const rightPriority = getPriority(rhs.blockchain);
  if (leftPriority > rightPriority) {
    return -1;
  } else if (rightPriority > leftPriority) {
    return 1;
  }
});
``` 
If leftPriority equals rightPriority, the function does not return a value. This can result in undefined behavior.
Impact: Balances with the same priority are not consistently ordered, which can lead to unpredictable UI behavior.

Fix: Add handling for ties:
```tsx
return rightPriority - leftPriority;
``` 

2. Type and Interface Issues

a. Missing blockchain in WalletBalance
Problem: The code accesses balance.blockchain, but the WalletBalance interface does not define a blockchain property:

```tsx
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
}
```
Impact: This causes a type error, as blockchain is not recognized as part of WalletBalance.

Fix: Add blockchain to the WalletBalance interface:

```tsx
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  blockchain: string;
}
```
b. Unsafe Typing of blockchain Parameter
Problem:

```tsx
const getPriority = (blockchain: any): number => { ... }
```
Using any for blockchain bypasses type checking, increasing the risk of runtime errors.
Impact: The function could receive invalid input, leading to unexpected results or crashes.

Fix: Replace any with a stricter type, such as string or a union type:
```tsx
const getPriority = (blockchain: string): number => { ... }
```
3. Mapping Errors
a. Type Mismatch in rows Mapping
Problem:
```tsx
const rows = sortedBalances.map((balance: FormattedWalletBalance, index: number) => { ... });
```
The sortedBalances array contains objects of type WalletBalance, but the code treats them as FormattedWalletBalance.
Impact: This could lead to runtime errors, as WalletBalance objects lack the formatted property expected by FormattedWalletBalance.

Fix: Ensure sortedBalances is properly mapped to FormattedWalletBalance before use:
```tsx

const formattedBalances = sortedBalances.map((balance: WalletBalance) => ({
  ...balance,
  formatted: balance.amount.toFixed(2),
}));
```
4. Formatting Inconsistency
a. Lack of Precision in formatted
Problem:
```tsx
formatted: balance.amount.toFixed();
```
toFixed() defaults to no decimal places, which may not be ideal for displaying balances.
Impact: The displayed balance could lose precision (e.g., 10.5 would become 10), potentially misleading users.

Fix: Use .toFixed(2) for two decimal places, ensuring clarity and consistency:
```tsx
formatted: balance.amount.toFixed(2);
```

5. Inefficient useMemo Dependencies
Problem:
```tsx
const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => { ... }, [balances, prices]);
```
The prices dependency is unnecessary, as it is not used in the computation of sortedBalances.
Impact: Adding unnecessary dependencies can trigger redundant recalculations, reducing performance.

Fix: Limit dependencies to only those directly used:
```tsx
const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => { ... }, [balances]);
```
